#"Shell" Script that launches mainServer and such

#main.py
#This file will download most recent files from dropbox folder, extract them to proper place, and restart the server.
#When server stops, will repeat the downloading. In case of errors, will send a groupMe message to the designated place, then wait and try again
#  it will try again every say, 5 minutes, and will send a message on success or failure first time, but none others

#Note: If the server stops due to an AssertionError, main interprets that as a request to return to the console of the server. It will not continue
#Note: You must install the "requests" library in order to use this

"""IMPORTANT NOTE: IN FILELIST, MAINSERVER.PY MUST GO LAST OR BAD THINGS!"""
#Actually, mainServer put into a main function. Shouldn't matter anymore...
