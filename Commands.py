### Command Class ###
#In addition to message functions, this module will contain functions to respond to commands (and manipulate data that could be used in them)
"""
A command will contain the various parts of a command. So a typical command could like
      @[bot name] [verb] [recipient] [specifier(s)] [command] [target/details]   
E.g.  @[botsly] [set] [my] [] [address] to [this place]
      @[botsly] [what] is [Zoe]'s [college] [address]? []
      @[botsly] [tell] [] [5 blonde] [jokes] []
      @[botsly] [] [] [] [joke] []
So the command will be able to return .bot .verb .recipient .specifier .command .details
